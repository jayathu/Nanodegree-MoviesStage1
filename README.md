This app fetches movie data from themoviedb.org and you will require an API from themoviedb.org in order to run the app. If you donâ€™t already have an account, you will need to create one in order to request an API Key.

Once you have obtained your own key, please do the following in order to run the app successfully:

1. Open PopularMoviesFragment Activity class. 
2. Navigate to the Async Task inner class. 
3. Look for api_key variable and assign your key to this.
4. Build and Run the app.
